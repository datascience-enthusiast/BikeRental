Hello,

Please Install 'xgboost' library in R and Python if you dont have it already on your environment.

Also, I was facing some library importing issues in R due to package name 'xgboost' was also used in 'inTrees' package. 

If you encounter any issues while running the xgboost model in R studio, Please load the 'xgboost' library from package explorer and try again.

Hopefully everything should work!
